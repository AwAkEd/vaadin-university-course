# PDF directory

Here are the slides in .pdf format. You need a .pdf file reader to be able to see them - and some of the slides may display incorrectly, as the original .pptx files contain animations and overlays.

The long-term goal is to store the outline of the slides and build .pdf and .pptx files from that.
